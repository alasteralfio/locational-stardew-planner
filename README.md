## Key Features

## Quick Start
Go to stardew-lsdp.github.io to start!
(Write user guide soon...)
  
## Technical Notes
Built on HTML5 Canvas + Fabric.js, with a multi-canvas layer system for performance at scale with better support for features such as grid snapping, overlays, location switching, and Y-Sorting.

I found this stack to support everything I need without excessive bloat and computing overhead.

## Development Status
Currently still under development. Public release planned for March 2026!

## Contributing

## FAQ
### Mobile Support?
Yes, mostly.

While this project aims to support all browsers, including on mobile devices, there is no set schedule for targeted development for mobile and small screens. Support is mainly prioritized for desktop browsers. All in all, most features (by the time of public release) will be functional on mobile, while some features can range from annoying to use, to outright unusable. 

Nevertheless, if there's a bug isolated to mobile environments, regardless how small, open an issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can!

### Modded Support? (Stardew Valley Expanded, etc)
Soon, but not yet.

Development for the first couple weeks to months following public release will be targeted at fixing issues and bugs rather than implementing new features. Working up modded support would require a slight redesign of the UI to ergonomically support more locations, and may even require back-end optimizations. These are both due to the sheer volume of modded locations.

However, once the public release has mostly stabilised, I'll aim to work on more features, including support for modded locations.
